I am tired of being used, hurt, and cast aside. It is my turn to use. My turn to hurt.
We live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world
When it is dark enough, you can see the stars
You are a manipulator said but I like to think of myself more as an outcome engineer
We are all like the bright moon, we still have our darker side.
It was the possibility of darkness that made the day seem so bright
I knew nothing but shadows and I thought them to be real.
I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me.
If You're Good at Something, never do it for free
It's not about money...it’s about sending a message. Everything burns!
Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just...DO things.
Smile, because it confuses people. Smile, because it’s easier than explaining what is killing you inside.
As you know, madness is like gravity…all it takes is a little push.
Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I’m an agent of chaos…
What doesn’t kill you, simply makes you stranger!
Let’s put a smile on that face!
And I thought my jokes were bad.
The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules. And tonight, you’re gonna break your one rule.
If the police expect to play against the Joker, they’d better be prepared to be dealt from the bottom of the deck!
Very neat! That ugly head of yours does have a brain!
I have given a name to my pain, and it is Love.
One by One, they’ll hear my call. Then this wicked town, will follow my fall.
Haven’t you ever heard of the healing power of laughter?
The pen, is truly mightier than the sword!
